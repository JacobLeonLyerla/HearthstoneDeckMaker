# HearthstoneDeckMaker
This is the deck maker i am working to help me my unserstanding of javaScript, and hopefully HTML/CSS.

the deck maker will ask the player what class they want, then give them a list of cards to choose from, only allowing one copy for legendary rarity cards,and two copies for every other rarirty.

it will give the player details about the card as they are entered, once the deck is full the deck object will be returned.

I will also like to create and apply further functions that would allow us to edit the deck, draw a test hand, draw a new card. as well as stuff like deck filtering, and returning averages, such as average card cost,
average card rating, and return a count of minions to spells, also running a check for if the deck is standard or not would also be good.

Further on i would like to create a draft mode to add to my deck maker that will allow simulated drafting, with types of drafts, such as standard, wild, and also set spacific so you'd only get a choice of cards from that set, the drafting feature may not work do to classes making it hard to draft, but i think we could figure this out.

Below is a list of functions i was working on and i would like  to refactor the current functions, as well as move on to the ones that have yet to be tackled.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//                    LIST OF FUNCTIONS I WANT TO WRITE(in no order)
// 1) A function that calculates the star value and returns a sum and total

// 2) A function that allows the user to choose the personsvalue they want to use



// 3) DONE A function that tells the player when the deck is full

// A) DONE A FUNCTION THAT ASK A PLAYER WHAT CLASS THEY WANT AND ONLY ALLOWS
// THAT CLASS AND NUERTRAL CARDS.


// 4)DONE A function that stores the cards the player wants store in deck 
// DONE ask the player the name of the card and the number they want
// DONE also function 4 must check if card is legendary and if so only allow one copy in deck

// 5) A function that allows makes roll get a random hand of card from their deck

// 6) A function that allows the player to draw an extra card that is not already in thier hand

// 7) A function that checks if the players deck is standard or not

// 8) A function(maybe more than one) that that can sort the deck based on cost,class, ect
